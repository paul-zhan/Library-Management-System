I spend a lot of time on the coursework.

I will explain the reservation process. When a book is available the person can checkout straight away. I
f the book is not available the person can reserve the book. If the book is reserved then no one can reserve the book until the person checkout the book.

I really enjoy the coursework. Even though they are ups and downs I manage to bring it into one piece.
For the recommendation system. I used the popularity based recommendation system.
One extra feature that I added is that, We can search by genre instead of title.

There will be two warning at the beginning. Since it' a warning I didn't try to catch it.
To have a good experience, It s better to use it full screen.
enjoy
